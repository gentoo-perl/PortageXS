PortageXS is kind of a portage-perl-api thing if you want to call it this way.

Main focus is to provide functions to access and manipulate portage in any
ways. All functions and methods are written with one primary goal in mind:
Keep it simple but effective. (And maintainable of course.)

To get to know how to use PortageXS have a look at the examples directory.

Examples are installed in this location:
perl -e 'use PortageXS; $pxs=PortageXS->new(); foreach($pxs->getFilesOfInstalledPackage("PortageXS")) { if ($_=~m/examples/) { print $_."\n"; } }'

Enjoy!
